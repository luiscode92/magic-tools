## Why Make AtomicEdits?

In 2020, I quit my tech job to pursue creating content on [YouTube](youtube.com/SuboptimalEng) full-time.
The biggest problem I had with making videos was editing/removing silence from them.
(For reference, it takes 1-2 hours to edit 10 minutes of video.) I put aside 2-3 weeks in June to learn video
editing technologies (WaveSurfer.js + FFmpeg) and make a proof of concept - this is the result.
It's really rough around the edges, but saves me some time while editing.

## Main Features

- Automatically detect silence in the video
- Generate silent regions based on length and loudness
- Remove detected silent regions on export
- Add/remove padding to silent regions

## Tech Stack

- Vue/Vuex
- Font Awesome (icons)
- Tailwind CSS (core UI)
- Electron.js (desktop app)
- WaveSurfer.js (audio wave display)
- Fluent FFmpeg (export edited video)
- Hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts)
